QuaaxTM is a PHP Topic Maps engine which implements PHPTMAPI. See 
http://phptmapi.sourceforge.net/ for details. This version of QuaaxTM implements 
PHPTMAPI 2.0.1. 
QuaaxTM stores topic maps in a MySQL database and uses InnoDB as storage engine.
See lib/quaaxtmio for the Topic Maps syntaxes serializer/deserializer library QuaaxTMIO. 

Installation
------------
Prerequisites:
a) PHP >= 5.2 with SPL enabled (PHP 5.3 is recommended)
b) MySQL >= 5.0 with InnoDB enabled

1. Execute src/qtm_schema.sql.
2. Edit your specific settings in lib/phptmapi2.0/config.php and src/phptmapi/config.php.
3. If PHPUnit is available (http://www.phpunit.de/) you should be able to run the test
   suite now: Open a terminal, move to 'tests', and execute phpunit AllCoreTests.php and/or 
   phpunit AllIndexTests.php. 
   Each test can be executed separately. Have a look at AllCoreTests.php how QuaaxTM is 
   used - you just have to include TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php from PHPTMAPI.

Note: If you compile PHP on your own please be sure to enable "mysqli" for QuaaxTM core and 
"reflection", "spl", "xml", and "tokenizer" for PHPUnit (thanks Benjamin Bock). QuaaxTMIO's 
CXTM writer also needs the "intl" module.
