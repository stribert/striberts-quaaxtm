PHPTMAPI 2.0 is the new generation of PHPTMAPI which supports
the Topic Maps Data Model (TMDM).

See the project's homepage http://phptmapi.sourceforge.net/ for 
documentation, implementation example, compliance tests, bug reporting, 
and support. See LICENSE for license information.

PHPTMAPI is NOT a Topic Maps processor! In order to connect 
PHPTMAPI 2.0 with your implementation you have to specify the 
path and the class name of your implementation of TopicMapSystemFactory 
in config.php. 
Include PHPTMAPI's TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php in your application 
which then provides your implementation of TopicMapSystemFactory 
via TopicMapSystemFactory::newInstance().
