QuaaxTMIO is the Topic Maps syntaxes serializer/deserializer library for QuaaxTM.
QuaaxTMIO currently supports serialization and deserialization of XTM 2.0, XTM 2.1, 
and JTM 1.0 - and it also supports deserialization of JTM 1.1.
QuaaxTM is a PHP Topic Maps engine with persistent storage. See 
http://quaaxtm.sourceforge.net/ for details.

Installation
------------
No real installation needed. Just some prerequisites have to be considered.

Prerequisites:
1) QuaaxTM >= 0.52 or latest QuaaxTM from SVN (ready for use)
2) PEAR Net_URL2 0.3.1 (see http://pear.php.net/package/Net_URL2/)
3) PHP Normalizer class (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.normalizer.php) 
   for the CXTM writer used in the unit tests.

If PHPUnit is available (http://www.phpunit.de/) you should be able to run the test 
suite now: Open a terminal, move to 'tests', and execute phpunit AllTests.php.

Examples
--------
Have a look at tests/TestCase.php how QuaaxTM is connected - you just have to include 
TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php from PHPTMAPI.
Once QuaaxTM is set up correctly PHPTMAPI's config.php provides all the information of 
QuaaxTM's implementation of TopicMapSystemFactory.

XTM 2.1 deserialization
Using the deserializer is quite simple:
- $tmSystemFactory = TopicMapSystemFactory::newInstance();
- $tmSystem = $tmSystemFactory->newTopicMapSystem();
- $tmHandler = new PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler($tmSystem, 'tmlocator');
- $reader = new XTM201TopicMapReader($tmHandler);
- $reader->readFile('path/to/file.xtm');// or use $reader->read($xtm)
- $topicMap = $tmSystem->getTopicMap('tmlocator');// the deserialized topic map

The files you need to include are TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php, 
PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler.class.php, and XTM201TopicMapReader.class.php.
   
XTM 2.1 serialization
Using the serializer is also simple:
- $tmSystemFactory = TopicMapSystemFactory::newInstance();
- $tmSystem = $tmSystemFactory->newTopicMapSystem();
- $topicMap = $tmSystem->getTopicMap('tmlocator');
- $xtmWriter = new PHPTMAPIXTM201Writer();
- $xtm = $xtmWriter->write($topicMap, 'tmlocator');

The files you need to include are TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php, 
PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler.class.php, and PHPTMAPIXTM201Writer.class.php.
