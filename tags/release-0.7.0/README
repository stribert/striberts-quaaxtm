QuaaxTM is a PHP Topic Maps engine which implements PHPTMAPI. See 
http://phptmapi.sourceforge.net/ for details. This version of QuaaxTM implements 
PHPTMAPI 2.0.1. 
QuaaxTM stores topic maps in a MySQL database and uses InnoDB as storage engine.
See lib/quaaxtmio for the Topic Maps syntaxes serializer / deserializer library QuaaxTMIO. 

Installation
------------
Prerequisites:
a) PHP >= 5.2 with SPL enabled (PHP >=5.3 is recommended)
b) MySQL >= 5.0 with InnoDB enabled
c) Optional: memcached and libmemcached based PECL extension for using the QuaaxTM MySQL query result 
   cache. See http://memcached.org/, http://libmemcached.org/, and 
   http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php. This version of QuaaxTM is tested against 
   memcached 1.4.5, libmemcached 0.40, and PECL memcached extension 1.0.2.
   Note: The result cache is currently only available in AssociationImpl::getRoles(), 
   AssociationImpl::getRoleTypes(), and TopicMapImpl::getAssociations(). See example.php how this 
   feature can be enabled using the feature string mechanics. 

1. Execute src/qtm_schema.sql.
2. Edit your specific settings in lib/phptmapi2.0/config.php and src/phptmapi/config.php.
3. If PHPUnit (http://www.phpunit.de) is available you will be able to run the test
   suite: Open a terminal, move to 'tests', and execute phpunit AllTests.php. 
   Each test can be executed separately. Have a look at tests/AllTests.php or example.php 
   how QuaaxTM is used - you just have to include TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php from PHPTMAPI.

Documentation
-------------
Have a look at the project's homepage http://quaaxtm.sourceforge.net/ for API documentation
