QuaaxTM is a small Topic Maps engine which implements PHPTMAPI 
(see http://phptmapi.sourceforge.net/ for details). This version of QuaaxTM implements 
PHPTMAPI 2.0.
QuaaxTM stores topic maps in a MySQL database and uses InnoDB as storage engine.

Installation
------------
Prerequisites:
a) PHP >= 5.1.2 with SPL enabled 
b) MySQL >= 5.0 with InnoDB enabled

1. Execute qtm_schema.sql.
2. Edit your specific settings in lib/phptmapi2.0/config.php (left mine for illustration).
3. If PHPUnit is available (http://www.phpunit.de/) you should be able to run the test
   suite now: Move to 'tests' and execute $ phpunit AllCoreTests.php. Each test can be
   executed separately. Have a look at AllCoreTests.php how QuaaxTM is used - you just
   have to include TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php from PHPTMAPI.
   
Have a look at http://phptmapi.wiki.sourceforge.net/Development+of+PHPTMAPI+2.0 for API 
information and usage. Please notice that PHPTMAPI 2.0 is not yet finished, and therefore 
this version of QuaaxTM not yet finished too.

Pretesters who have installed PHP 5.3.0 RC2 had to set their error reporting to 
error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE | E_NOTICE) as function eregi() is 
deprecated in 5.3.
