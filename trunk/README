QuaaxTM is a small Topic Maps engine which implements PHPTMAPI 
(see http://phptmapi.sourceforge.net/ for details). This version of QuaaxTM implements 
PHPTMAPI 2.0.
QuaaxTM stores topic maps in a MySQL database and uses InnoDB as storage engine.

Installation
------------
Prerequisites:
a) PHP >= 5.1.2 with SPL enabled 
b) MySQL >= 5.0 with InnoDB enabled

1. Execute qtm_schema.sql.
2. Edit your specific settings in lib/phptmapi2.0/config.php (left mine for illustration).
3. If PHPUnit is available (http://www.phpunit.de/) you should be able to run the test
   suite now: Move to 'tests' and execute $ phpunit AllCoreTests.php. Each test can be
   executed separately. Have a look at AllCoreTests.php how QuaaxTM is used - you just
   have to include TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php from PHPTMAPI.
   
Have a look at http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/phptmapi/wiki/Development%20of%20PHPTMAPI%202.0 for API 
information and usage. Please notice that PHPTMAPI 2.0 is not yet finished, and therefore 
this version of QuaaxTM is not yet finished too.
