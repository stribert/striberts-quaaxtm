QuaaxTMIO is the Topic Maps syntaxes serializer/deserializer library for QuaaxTM.
QuaaxTM is a small PHP Topic Maps engine with persistent storage. See 
http://quaaxtm.sourceforge.net/ for details.

Installation
------------
No real installation needed. Just some prerequisites have to be considered.

Prerequisites:
a) Latest QuaaxTM from SVN (ready for use)
b) PEAR Net_URL2 0.3.1 (see http://pear.php.net/package/Net_URL2/)
c) PHP Normalizer class (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.normalizer.php)

Example: Deserialization of XTM 2.0:
1. Once QuaaxTM is ready for use and PHPUnit is available (http://www.phpunit.de/) you 
   should be able to run the tests now: Open a terminal, move to 'tests/in', and execute 
   phpunit Xtm20Test.php. 
   Have a look at tests/TestCase.php how QuaaxTM is connected - you just have to include 
   TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php from PHPTMAPI.
   Once QuaaxTM is set up correctly PHPTMAPI's config.php provides all the information of 
   QuaaxTM's implementation of TopicMapSystemFactory.
2. Using the deserializer is quite simple:
   - $tmSystemFactory = TopicMapSystemFactory::newInstance();
   - $tmSystem = $tmSystemFactory->newTopicMapSystem();
   - $tmHandler = new PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler($tmSystem, 'tmlocator');
   - $reader = new XTM20TopicMapReader($tmHandler);
   - $reader->readXtmFile('path/to/file.xtm');
   - $tm = $tmSystem->getTopicMap('tmlocator');// the deserialized topic map
   The files you need to include are TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php, 
   PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler.class.php, and XTM20TopicMapReader.class.php.
