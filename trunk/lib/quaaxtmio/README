QuaaxTMIO is the Topic Maps syntaxes serializer/deserializer library for QuaaxTM.
QuaaxTM is a small PHP Topic Maps engine with persistent storage. See 
http://quaaxtm.sourceforge.net/ for details.

Installation
------------
No real installation needed. Just some prerequisites have to be considered.

Prerequisites:
1) QuaaxTM 0.52 or latest QuaaxTM from SVN (ready for use)
2) PEAR Net_URL2 0.3.1 (see http://pear.php.net/package/Net_URL2/)
3) PHP Normalizer class (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.normalizer.php)

Examples
--------
QuaaxTM must be ready for use (see QuaaxTM's README) and PHPUnit (http://www.phpunit.de/) 
must be available.

Deserialization of XTM 2.0:
1) To check the setup run the CXTM based tests: Open a terminal, move to 'tests/in', and execute 
   phpunit Xtm20Test.php.
   Have a look at tests/TestCase.php how QuaaxTM is connected - you just have to include 
   TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php from PHPTMAPI.
   Once QuaaxTM is set up correctly PHPTMAPI's config.php provides all the information of 
   QuaaxTM's implementation of TopicMapSystemFactory.
2) Using the deserializer is quite simple:
   - $tmSystemFactory = TopicMapSystemFactory::newInstance();
   - $tmSystem = $tmSystemFactory->newTopicMapSystem();
   - $tmHandler = new PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler($tmSystem, 'tmlocator');
   - $reader = new XTM20TopicMapReader($tmHandler);
   - $reader->readXtmFile('path/to/file.xtm');// or use $reader->readXtm($xtm)
   - $topicMap = $tmSystem->getTopicMap('tmlocator');// the deserialized topic map
   The files you need to include are TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php, 
   PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler.class.php, and XTM20TopicMapReader.class.php.
   
XTM 2.0 serialization:
1) To check the setup run the CXTM based tests: Open a terminal, move to 'tests/out', and execute 
   phpunit Xtm20Test.php.
2) Using the serializer is also simple:
   - $tmSystemFactory = TopicMapSystemFactory::newInstance();
   - $tmSystem = $tmSystemFactory->newTopicMapSystem();
   - $topicMap = $tmSystem->getTopicMap('tmlocator');
   - $xtmWriter = new PHPTMAPIXTM20Writer();
   - $xtm = $xtmWriter->write($topicMap, 'tmlocator');
   The files you need to include are TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php, 
   PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler.class.php, and PHPTMAPIXTM20Writer.class.php.
