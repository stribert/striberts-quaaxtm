QuaaxTMIO is the Topic Maps syntaxes serializer / deserializer library for QuaaxTM.
It currently supports serialization to and deserialization of XTM 2.0, XTM 2.1, and 
JTM 1.0 - and also supports deserialization of JTM 1.1.
QuaaxTMIO also provides a CXTM writer which is used in the unit tests. 

QuaaxTM is a PHP Topic Maps engine with persistent storage. See 
../../README or http://quaaxtm.sourceforge.net/ for details.

Installation
------------
No real installation needed. Just some prerequisites have to be considered.

Prerequisites:
1) QuaaxTM >= 0.52 or latest QuaaxTM from SVN (ready for use)
2) PEAR Net_URL2 0.3.1 (see http://pear.php.net/package/Net_URL2/)
3) PHP cURL support (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php)
4) PHP Normalizer class (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.normalizer.php) 
   for the CXTM writer used in the unit tests.

If PHPUnit (http://www.phpunit.de/) is available you will be able to run the test 
suite: Open a terminal, move to 'tests', and execute phpunit AllTests.php.

Examples
--------
Have a look at tests/TestCase.php how QuaaxTM is connected - you just have to include 
TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php from PHPTMAPI. PHPTMAPI is provided in ../phptmapi2.0.
Once QuaaxTM is set up correctly PHPTMAPI's config.php provides all information about 
QuaaxTM's implementation of TopicMapSystemFactory.

XTM 2.1 serialization
Using the serializer is quite simple: Have a look at ../../example.php how a created topic map 
is serialized to XTM 2.1.

XTM 2.1 deserialization
Using the deserializer is also simple:
- $tmSystemFactory = TopicMapSystemFactory::newInstance();
- $tmSystem = $tmSystemFactory->newTopicMapSystem();
- $tmHandler = new PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler($tmSystem, 'http://localhost/topicmaps/1');
- $reader = new XTM201TopicMapReader($tmHandler);
- $reader->readFile('path/to/file.xtm');// or use $reader->read($xtm)
- $topicMap = $tmSystem->getTopicMap('http://localhost/topicmaps/1');// the deserialized topic map

The files you need to require_once() are ../phptmapi2.0/core/TopicMapSystemFactory.class.php, 
src/in/PHPTMAPITopicMapHandler.class.php, and src/in/XTM201TopicMapReader.class.php.
